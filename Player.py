#Class Player is used as the top level class abstraction to play in a Tournament
#It specifies what a concrete Player must do to be a part of the Tournament
#Each Player can be registered for a Tournament
#Concrete implementations of a Player will play against other ones playing
#the same game.
#Since there can be many player types for many games
#the AI for making moves in the 'play' function must be
#delegated to the concrete implementations that subclass Player.

#Ex: A Rock Paper Scissors Player that subclasses Player would
#define some AI in 'play' to return 'rock' 'paper or 'scissors'

    #it takes in move history of opponent

    def get_name(self):
